# **Project Optimization: Performance, Accuracy & Efficiency**

## **1. Performance Bottlenecks & API Call Reduction**

### **a. Batching and Parallelism**
- **Current:** Each question is processed sequentially through parsing, embedding, retrieval, fusion, reranking, and answer generation, with limited `asyncio` parallelism.
- **Problem:** Without true batching, each step (especially LLM/embedding calls) results in *N* API calls per question → high latency and cost.
- **Solutions:**
  - ✅ **Batch Embeddings:** Ensure all embedding models (OpenAI, Sentence-Transformers) use batched input where possible.
  - ✅ **Batch LLM Calls:** Use batch endpoints or prompt chaining to process multiple questions in a single call (e.g., for query rewriting or answer generation).
  - ✅ **Batch Reranking:** Leverage cross-encoder support for batch inference — pass all (query, document) pairs at once.

---

### **b. Reduce LLM Calls**
- **Current:** Gemini/OpenAI called individually per question for rewriting, answering, or reranking.
- **Impact:** High latency, cost, and rate-limit risks.
- **Solutions:**
  - 💾 **Cache LLM Results:** Use persistent caching (Redis, SQLite) for:
    - Rewritten queries
    - Generated answers
  - 🔁 **Rewrite Once:** Avoid redundant rewrites across retrieval stages.
  - 📦 **Answer in Bulk:** Send all questions + top contexts in a single structured prompt to the LLM.

---

### **c. Optimize Retrieval**
- **Current:** Both dense (vector) and sparse (BM25) retrieval run for every question → fusion → reranking.
- **Opportunity:** Reduce compute load downstream.
- **Solutions:**
  - ⬇️ **Tune `TOP_K`:** Reduce from 10 → 3–5 if accuracy allows.
  - 🔍 **Early Filtering:** Apply lightweight filters (e.g., metadata, relevance heuristics) before expensive reranking/LLM steps.

---

## **2. Accuracy Improvements**

### **a. Reranker Quality**
- **Current:** Using cross-encoder reranker (good baseline).
- **Improvement Path:**
  - 🧠 **Model Upgrade:** Use higher-quality models (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`, or larger variants like `xlm-r-bert-base`).
  - 🎯 **Fine-Tuning:** If labeled relevance data exists, fine-tune on domain-specific queries/documents.

---

### **b. Prompt Engineering**
- **Current:** LLM prompts used for query rewriting and answer generation.
- **Optimization:**
  - ✍️ **Prompt Iteration:** A/B test prompts for clarity, instruction strength, and output consistency.
  - 📏 **Context Window Management:**
    - Provide sufficient context (top 3–5 chunks)
    - Avoid context overflow → truncate or summarize when needed.

---

## **3. System & Code Efficiency**

### **a. Async and Threading**
- **Current:** Uses `asyncio.to_thread` for concurrency.
- **Improvement:**
  - ⚡ **True Async I/O:** Replace sync HTTP clients with `httpx` (async) for API calls.
  - 🧵 **ThreadPool for CPU Tasks:** Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for CPU-heavy operations:
    - Embedding
    - Reranking
    - Index search

---

### **b. Indexing**
- **Current:** FAISS/BM25 indices built or loaded at startup.
- **Optimization:**
  - 💾 **Persistent Index Storage:** Save indices to disk; load on startup instead of rebuilding.
  - 🗺️ **Memory Mapping:** Use `mmap` for large FAISS indices to reduce memory footprint and speed up load.

---

## **4. API Design**

### **a. Batch Endpoint**
- **Current:** Single endpoint accepts multiple questions but may process them sequentially.
- **Goal:** End-to-end batching.
- **Solution:**
  - 🔄 Ensure **all internal steps** (embedding → retrieval → reranking → LLM) are batched during processing.

---

### **b. Streaming Responses (Optional)**
- For long-running batches:
  - 🌊 Stream partial results (e.g., one answer at a time) using SSE or WebSockets.
  - Improves perceived performance and UX.

---

## **5. Monitoring & Profiling**

### **Essential Observability Additions:**
- 🕒 **Timing Logs:** Log duration per stage:
  - Embedding
  - Retrieval
  - Reranking
  - LLM call
- 🔍 **Profiling:** Use `cProfile` or `py-spy` to identify CPU/memory bottlenecks.
- 📊 **API Usage Tracking:** Monitor:
  - Number of external API calls
  - Token usage
  - Error rates

> *Example:* Currently 13 API calls for 10 questions → target: **2–3 total batched calls**.

---

## **6. Hardware & Deployment**

### **Optimal Runtime Setup:**
- 🟩 **GPU Acceleration:**
  - Run embedding and reranking models on GPU (e.g., via `sentence-transformers` + CUDA).
  - Can reduce inference time by 5–10x.
- 🚀 **Horizontal Scaling:**
  - Deploy with multiple workers: `uvicorn --workers 4`
  - Enables concurrent request handling.
